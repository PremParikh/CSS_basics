        <button class="btn-blue">Right Handed</button>
            <button class="btn-Green">Virat Kohli needs no introduction. Former India captain relinquished his role as captain for the Royal Challengers Bangalore after having led the franchise for 9 years. He made his IPL debut in the first-ever match of the IPL on April 18th, 2008 against Kolkata Knight Riders at RCB’s home ground, M.Chinnaswamy Stadium. Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the IPL and holds the record for the most number of centuries (4) in an IPL season.</button>

        <button class="btn-blue">BATSMAN</button>
            <button class="btn-Green">A leading moniker of the shortest format of the sport and a man whose hands are safer than your houses, Faf du Plessis will be joining the ranks of Challengers for the first time. An experienced right-handed batter who can ace any bowler in the world, display exemplary strokeplay and control will be leading the batting-order of the Challengers in their new quest. The South African opener played a crucial role in Chennai’s title-campaign in 2021. His addition to the side at a price of Rs 7 crore will be a massive boost to a side whose title quest will be renewed with new verve and vigour.</button>

        <button class="btn-blue">Right Handed</button>
        <button class="btn-Green">Mohammed Siraj is one of the premier fast bowlers of the Hyderabad side on the domestic circuit. He was bought by RCB in the 2018 season of the IPL for a sum of INR 2.6 Crores. Given his potential, he can well be a great bowler in all three formats of the game for the Indian side in the years to come.</button>

        <button class="btn-blue">Right Handed</button>
            <button class="btn-Green">Dinesh Karthik, the man who was responsible for India’s incredible win against Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy final, will be donning the RCB jersey for the second time. An incredibly fine wicket-keeper and a decent striker of the ball who can brew a storm if he gets going, Karthik stirred the paddles for quite a significant number of times. Royal Challengers Bangalore wrested him from the jaws of Chennai Super Kings after an intense bidding war for Rs 5.50 crore.

        <button class="btn-Green">21 Feb 1994</button>
        <button class="btn-blue">Left Handed</button>
        <button class="btn-Green">Known for his fearsome yorker and his finesse of angling the ball both ways from the batter, the English fast bowler is a beast in the making. Towering at 6’7, the lanky southpaw started his county career with two fifers in three games while the aura amplified in the 2012 U19 World Cup with Topley claiming 19 wickets for himself. Barring the unfortunate injuries, Topley has established himself as a mainstay in the current English pace unit, and with 168 T20 wickets in his tally, he comes forth as an obvious menace to the pace unit of RCB.</button>

        <button class="btn-blue">Right Handed</button>
        <button class="btn-Green">The hard-hitting phenomenon who grabbed a lot of eyeballs with a swashbuckling century from just 25 balls in a T10 game is deemed a valuable all-rounder who makes T20 his forte. Known for his clean and ginormous strikes, Jacks was a part of Surrey’s youth brigade that propelled the county contingent to a swashbuckling championship in 2018. With a T20 strike rate of 154 and an average of 29.10, Jacks can be an absolute revelation in the echelons of RCB.</button>
